# AI-Powered Campaign Recommendation Engine Implementation

## Project Summary
This document outlines the implementation of the AI-Powered Campaign Recommendation Engine for AdTrack.online. This feature enhances the platform's capabilities by providing personalized, data-driven advertising recommendations to business users.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components
1. **Core Recommendation Engine**
   - Created `recommendationEngine.ts` with AI integration using Anthropic's Claude
   - Implemented data analysis functions to process business campaign performance
   - Added fallback recommendation logic for when AI is unavailable
   - Built JSON parsing and formatting functions for structured recommendations

2. **Database Integration**
   - Added storage methods in `storage.ts` for recommendation persistence
   - Implemented methods for retrieving, updating, and tracking interactions with recommendations
   - Created database queries with proper sorting and relationships for retrieving recommendations

3. **API Endpoints**
   - Added endpoint for generating new recommendations (`POST /api/ad-recommendations`)
   - Added endpoint for retrieving existing recommendations (`GET /api/ad-recommendations/:businessId`)
   - Added endpoint for tracking user interactions with recommendations (`POST /api/ad-recommendations/:recommendationId/interaction`)

### Frontend Components
1. **AdRecommendations Component**
   - Created React component with interactive UI for viewing recommendations
   - Implemented budget scenario selector (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive)
   - Added data visualization for predicted ROI
   - Implemented user interaction tracking (Implement/Dismiss)

2. **Dashboard Integration**
   - Added the component to the dashboard page
   - Added data fetching logic for user's business information
   - Added onboarding tour step explaining the new feature

## Technical Implementation

### AI Integration
The recommendation engine uses Claude 3.7 Sonnet, connected via the Anthropic SDK. The integration:
- Analyzes user's campaign history
- Compares performance with similar businesses
- Considers geographic and industry-specific data
- Generates recommendations with confidence scores and rationales

### Recommendation Structure
Each recommendation includes:
- Specific ad method to implement
- Rank/priority (1-3)
- Predicted ROI percentage
- Recommended budget allocation
- Detailed rationale explaining why this method would work well
- Confidence score (0.1-1.0)
- Multiple budget scenarios (conservative, moderate, aggressive)

### User Experience Flow
1. User views dashboard and sees the recommendation section
2. On first visit, user clicks "Generate Recommendations"
3. System analyzes their business data and generates tailored recommendations
4. User can view recommendations, toggle between budget scenarios
5. User can implement or dismiss recommendations
6. System tracks these interactions to improve future recommendations

## Key Features
- AI-powered analysis of campaign performance
- Multiple budget scenarios with ROI predictions
- Interactive recommendation cards with implementation tracking
- Confidence scoring to indicate recommendation reliability
- Detailed rationales explaining each recommendation
- Automatic recommendation refreshing

## Technologies Used
- Anthropic Claude AI API
- React with TypeScript
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- Drizzle ORM for database operations
- Shadcn UI components
- Circular progress visualizations

## Screenshots
Screenshots of the implementation are available in the application or can be generated by viewing the dashboard page.
