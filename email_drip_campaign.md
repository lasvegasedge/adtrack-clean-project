```
Hello [First Name],

Thank you for your interest in AdTrack!

If you're like most business owners we talk to, you're facing a common challenge: 
knowing exactly which marketing efforts are worth your money and which are draining your budget.

Think about it:
• How much did that Facebook campaign really bring in?
• Was that local newspaper ad worth the investment?
• Are your Google Ads outperforming your Instagram posts?

Without clear data, these questions lead to gut-feeling decisions that cost businesses an average of 26% of their marketing budget on ineffective channels.

AdTrack was built to solve this exact problem for businesses like yours.

Over the next few weeks, I'll show you how our platform makes it ridiculously easy to:
✓ Track the ROI of every marketing dollar you spend
✓ Compare your results with similar businesses in your area
✓ Get AI-powered recommendations for improving your advertising mix

## Email 5: Overcoming Objections
**Subject Line:** "I Don't Have Time to Track My Marketing" (and Other Myths)  
**Send Timing:** 7 days after Email 4  

```
Hello [First Name],

In our conversations with business owners, we hear a few common concerns about implementing marketing analytics. Let me address them directly:

"I don't have time to track all my marketing efforts."
✓ AdTrack is designed for busy business owners. Most users spend less than 5 minutes per day logging campaign information. Plus, our mobile app lets you update campaigns from anywhere.

"My business is too small to need analytics."
✓ Actually, smaller businesses benefit most from AdTrack because every marketing dollar counts. One of our smallest clients (a 3-person operation) saved $12,000 annually by redirecting budget from underperforming channels.

"I'm not tech-savvy enough to use an analytics platform."
✓ If you can use a smartphone, you can use AdTrack. Our interface is intentionally simple, and our Quick Start Guide gets you set up in under 15 minutes.

"I won't get enough data to make meaningful comparisons."
✓ AdTrack's local business database already includes performance data from thousands of businesses across hundreds of categories. You'll have meaningful benchmarks from day one.

Still unsure? Our 7-day free trial requires no credit card, and you can cancel anytime with one click.
