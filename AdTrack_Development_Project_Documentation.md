## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: ROI/ROAS Time Normalization
**Problem**: Comparing advertising methods with different campaign durations could lead to misleading ROI comparisons.

**Solution**: Implemented time normalization in the AdPerformanceComparison component to calculate ROI on a per-day or per-week basis. This allows fair comparison between campaigns regardless of their duration.

### Challenge 2: Marketing Advisor Chatbot Integration
**Problem**: The Marketing Advisor chatbot wasn't sending the business ID to the backend API, resulting in a "No business associated with this account" error.

**Solution**: 
- Updated the frontend component (MarketingChatbot.tsx) to send the business ID with each request
- Modified the server endpoint to accept businessId from the request body
- Implemented fallback responses when API rate limits are exceeded

### Challenge 3: Cross-Category Feature Usage Analytics
**Problem**: The platform needed enhanced feature usage analytics to view data across multiple categories simultaneously.

**Solution**: Implemented a unified filter panel with combined results view, allowing simultaneous filtering by business type, city, state, year, month, and feature.

### Challenge 4: Privacy-Preserving Competitive Intelligence
**Problem**: Providing useful competitive insights while maintaining business privacy.

**Solution**: Created an anonymized ranking system that shows relative performance while obscuring business identities, using a geographic radius to ensure relevant comparisons while preserving privacy.

### Challenge 5: AI Integration Rate Limiting
**Problem**: OpenAI API rate limits causing service disruptions.

**Solution**: Implemented a robust fallback system that provides pre-generated responses when API limits are reached, ensuring continuous service availability.
