## Handling Specific Competitor Comparisons

### AdTrack vs. Google Analytics

**When Prospect Says:** "We already use Google Analytics for free. Why would we pay for AdTrack?"

- Highlight AdTrack's ability to connect revenue directly to marketing channels
- Emphasize local competitor benchmarking unavailable in GA
- Position AdTrack as the "business owner's view" vs. GA's "webmaster's view"
